#FizzBuzz

FizzBuzz is math game for kids, but is also could be interesting programmer task.
Defaults rules are:

- Print integers 1 to N, but print “Fizz” if an integer is divisible by 3,
- Print “Buzz” if an integer is divisible by 5
- Print “FizzBuzz” if an integer is divisible by both 3 and 5.

On branches i proposed two solutions in Java:

- Using functional interfaces with lambda expressions
- Using HashMap to define collections of additional conditions.

In my opinion - solution on branch 'FlexibleSolutionWithConditions' is more usable :)
